# Decisions

[← Documentation index](README.md)

An architecture decision record. Each entry captures what was chosen, what was
rejected, and — most importantly — **why**, so the reasoning survives even when
the person who made the call does not remember it.

---

## ADR-001 — redb as the storage engine

**Decision.** [redb](https://github.com/cberner/redb) 4.x.

**Alternatives.** RocksDB, a custom LSM/B-tree, `fjall`, `sled`.

**Why.** Pure Rust, so no C++ toolchain in the build or the container. ACID with
MVCC snapshots, giving many concurrent readers against one writer for free.
Typed table definitions with `memcmp` key ordering, which is exactly the
primitive an order-preserving key encoding wants. RocksDB would have been the
safe battle-tested pick but brings a C++ dependency and substantial tuning
surface; writing a storage engine would have delayed a usable database by
months; `sled` is effectively unmaintained.

**Cost.** One handle per database file, per process — discovered when a test
tried to open a second `Engine` for a writer thread. Share an `Arc<Engine>`.
Also less operational literature than RocksDB when something goes wrong.

---

## ADR-002 — BSON on disk, Extended JSON at the edge

**Decision.** Store BSON. Convert at the HTTP boundary using Extended JSON v2.

**Why.** Mongo-style comparison needs typed values and a defined cross-type
order. JSON has one number type and no dates, binary, or object ids. Storing
JSON would mean either losing types or inventing a parallel type system on top
of it — and then the query semantics people expect would not work.

Extended JSON keeps plain JSON working for everything expressible in it, so a
caller who does not care never meets the distinction.

**Consequence.** Whole numbers stay integers rather than widening to double.
Widening would break `$type` queries and lose precision above 2^53; `2^53 + 1`
round-trips exactly and there is a test pinning it.

---

## ADR-003 — Hand-rolled binary codec for hot records

**Decision.** Explicit byte layouts for `DocRecord` and `OplogEntry`, each with
a leading format version. JSON for collection metadata.

**Why.** A derive-based codec ties the on-disk layout to a dependency's internal
versioning — bincode 1.x and 2.x are mutually incompatible, and a database
cannot have its file format change because a dependency did. The oplog format is
*also* the replication wire format for M4, which doubles the reason to specify it
explicitly.

Metadata went the other way: it is read on open and on DDL, never in a hot path,
and reading it directly while diagnosing a broken data directory is worth more
than the bytes.

**Cost.** More code, and encode/decode symmetry has to be maintained by hand —
so every record type has a round-trip test, and truncation is tested at every
offset.

---

## ADR-004 — Two independent ordering implementations

**Decision.** `cmp::canonical_cmp` (semantics) and `keyenc::encode` (bytes) are
written independently and cross-checked by property tests.

**Why.** The invariant `encode(a).cmp(encode(b)) == canonical_cmp(a, b)` is what
makes indexes correct, and breaking it does not crash — it silently returns
wrong query results. Having the encoder delegate to the comparator would be less
code and strictly worse: a single implementation cannot catch its own
bit-manipulation errors. An oracle is the entire point.

**Follow-up.** The two are *not* independent for numbers, because `keyenc`
encodes through `cmp::decompose`. A bug there would corrupt both identically.
So numeric ordering is additionally checked against a third implementation
sharing no code with either. Both paths were mutation-tested to confirm the
tests actually detect injected faults.

---

## ADR-005 — Exact mantissa/exponent numeric encoding

**Decision.** Encode every number as `±mantissa × 2^(exp − 63)` rather than
converting to `f64`.

**Why.** Encoding through a double collapses `2^53` and `2^53 + 1` into the same
bytes, so two distinct `i64` values would share one index entry. Anyone using
large integer ids gets silently wrong results.

**Cost.** More complex encoder; `Decimal128` cannot be represented exactly and
is **refused** as an index key or `_id` rather than encoded approximately.
Refusing is honest; an approximate index key is a wrong answer waiting to
happen.

---

## ADR-006 — HLC with node-id tiebreak, whole-document LWW

**Decision.** Hybrid logical clocks; conflicts resolve by
`(wall_ms, counter, node_id)`, at whole-document granularity.

**Alternatives.** Per-field LWW, JSON CRDTs (Automerge-style), vector clocks.

**Why.** LWW is simple, predictable, and has bounded metadata — 26 bytes per
record. The node id makes ties deterministic, so every replica picks the same
winner regardless of arrival order. Per-field LWW preserves more but multiplies
metadata and complicates delete semantics; CRDTs preserve the most but are a
large subsystem with real storage overhead and are hard to make fast.

**Cost.** Concurrent edits to *different fields* of the same document lose one
of them. This is a real limitation, not a rough edge — documented prominently in
[Time & Conflicts](time-and-conflicts.md). `merge_policy` on `CollectionMeta` is
the intended extension point if the semantics need to change.

---

## ADR-007 — Physical time as a parameter

**Decision.** `kimmy-core` never reads the clock. `HlcClock::tick(physical_ms)`
takes time as an argument.

**Why.** Clock skew, backwards NTP jumps, stalls, and counter exhaustion are
exactly what an HLC exists to survive — and are nearly impossible to test
against a real clock. As parameters they become ordinary unit tests. This is not
purism; it is what made "NTP yanks the clock back a second" a two-line test.

---

## ADR-008 — The oplog is written unconditionally

**Decision.** Every mutation appends an oplog entry, in the same transaction,
whether or not the node is clustered.

**Why.** This is the central bet. It gives change streams on a single node — the
motivating requirement — because the log exists whether or not a peer ever
existed. It also makes the M2 embedding pipeline a plain change-stream
subscriber rather than a scheduler, and gives M4 replication a ready-made
source.

**Cost.** Write amplification: every write stores the document twice, since
entries carry full post-images. Bounded by retention (📋 not yet implemented).
Full images were chosen over diffs because they make replication idempotent and
order-independent.

---

## ADR-009 — Subscribe before replaying

**Decision.** A change stream subscribes to the live broadcast **first**, then
replays the oplog, then deduplicates the overlap.

**Why.** The reverse order leaves a window between the read and the subscription
in which committed events reach nobody. That gap is silent, intermittent, and
load-dependent — it only manifests when a write lands in exactly the wrong
microsecond, which is to say: in production, not in testing.

It gets a dedicated test that writes concurrently across a simulated disconnect
and asserts the delivered sequence is exactly complete.

---

## ADR-010 — Lag recovers from the oplog

**Decision.** A subscriber that falls behind the in-memory buffer rewinds and
replays from disk rather than being invalidated.

**Why.** The plan originally called for `invalidate`. Writing the test made it
obvious that the same events are on disk, so invalidation throws away a
capability the design already has. Recovery is bounded by a resume floor so it
cannot resurrect history the client deliberately skipped.

**Consequence.** `ChangeEvent::Invalidate` is currently unreachable, and is
documented as such rather than left looking live. It becomes reachable when
oplog collection can remove a stream's replay range underneath it.

---

## ADR-011 — HTTP/JSON + WebSocket, not the MongoDB wire protocol

**Decision.** REST-ish HTTP with WebSocket change streams.

**Alternatives.** MongoDB wire protocol (existing drivers would just work),
gRPC, a custom binary protocol.

**Why.** Wire-protocol compatibility is a large surface — opcodes, cursors,
SCRAM, the `hello` handshake — and it would lock the data model to Mongo's
semantics permanently. HTTP works from curl and every language without a driver,
and the MCP layer (M3) is HTTP anyway.

**Cost.** No existing Mongo tooling — Compass, `mongosh`, existing drivers — and
higher per-request overhead than a binary protocol.

---

## ADR-012 — JWT with embedded grants

**Decision.** HS256 tokens carrying grants, signed with a cluster-wide secret.

**Why.** In a leaderless cluster a request may land on any node. A per-node key
would produce intermittent 401s that only appear under load balancing.
Embedding grants keeps verification a pure function of the token — no store
lookup on the hot path, no cross-node consistency requirement for authorization.

**Cost.** **No revocation.** Deleting a user or narrowing grants only takes
effect when the token expires — hence the one-hour default. Cutting off access
immediately requires rotating the secret, which invalidates every token. This is
stated plainly in [Security](security.md) rather than left to be discovered.

---

## ADR-013 — One authorization decision point

**Decision.** `Principal::can()` is the only place that answers "may this
principal do this?", and authorization is an axum *extractor*, not middleware.

**Why.** A second enforcement path is exactly how an MCP tool (M3) ends up
quietly more permissive than the REST route beside it. As an extractor, a route
that needs a principal takes one and a route that does not is visibly public —
with middleware, "which routes are protected?" is a question you answer by
reading a registration list.

**Related.** Authorization runs *before* the collection is resolved, so a denied
request cannot distinguish "forbidden" from "does not exist". A 404 there would
let a caller probe for collections they cannot access.

---

## ADR-014 — `write` implies `read`; `read` does not imply `watch`

**Decision.** Action implication is `admin ⊃ {write, watch, read, search}`,
`write ⊃ read`, `read ⊃ search`. `watch` stands alone.

**Why.** An update must read the document it modifies, so requiring both
separately would make every writer role wrong by default. Vector search is a
read. But a change-stream subscriber sees every change to a collection
*continuously*, which is a materially different exposure from point reads — so
it must be granted deliberately.

---

## ADR-015 — Callback-based collection scans

**Decision.** `for_each_doc(coll, |id, doc| -> Result<bool>)` rather than
returning an iterator or a `Vec`.

**Why.** redb's range borrows its transaction. Returning an iterator would leak
that lifetime into every caller; returning a `Vec` would materialize whole
collections in memory. The callback returns `false` to stop early, which keeps
paging cheap for unsorted queries.

---

## ADR-016 — Pure-Rust cryptography

**Decision.** `jsonwebtoken` with the `rust_crypto` feature; `argon2` pinned to
stable 0.5 rather than the 0.6 release candidate.

**Why.** `aws_lc_rs` would reintroduce a C toolchain dependency, undoing the
reason redb was chosen over RocksDB. And password hashing is not the place to
run ahead of a stable release.

---

## ADR-017 — Reserved `__` prefix, with an internal escape hatch

**Decision.** User-facing name validation rejects the `__` prefix. System
objects are created through `create_system_collection`, which skips that check.

**Why.** The user store lives in an ordinary collection
(`__kimmy.__users`), so it gets the same durability, oplog, and eventual
replication as any other data — rather than a parallel storage mechanism that
would need its own correctness argument. Reserving the prefix is what stops a
user from shadowing it.

---

## ADR-018 — Monotonic id counters, never reused

**Decision.** Collection and index ids come from persistent counters, allocated
in the same transaction as the object they identify.

**Why.** Deriving the next index id from `max(existing) + 1` reuses a dropped
index's id. A dropped index's entries are removed lazily, so a new index
inheriting the id would also inherit its stale entries — and return wrong
results. A test caught the contradiction between the implementation and its own
doc comment.

---

## ADR-019 — `find` is paged by default

**Decision.** 100 documents by default, 10,000 maximum.

**Why.** An unbounded `find` on a large collection would pull it entirely into
memory. A default cap makes the failure mode "you got fewer results than you
expected" rather than "the server fell over".

**Cost.** `skip` is O(n) and deep paging is expensive — and stays so until
indexes land.

## Superseded / reconsidered

| Original plan | Now | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Slow consumers get `invalidate` | Lag recovers from the oplog | ADR-010 |
| `keyenc` lives in `kimmy-storage` | Lives in `kimmy-core` | `kimmy-query` needs the comparison semantics; putting both in core avoids query→storage coupling |
| Node identity in a file beside the data | Inside the database file | Copying or restoring carries identity with it; one source of truth |
| Flat-then-HNSW vector index | HNSW from the start | User preference, taken during planning |
